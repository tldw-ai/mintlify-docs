# What is TL;DW?

TL;DW is a state-of-the-art AI model purpose-built to understand video just like humans. Our API enables developers to build AI-native, video-based applications, analytics, and hardware integrations.

# Key Features

**Semantic Video Embedding Generation:** Capture every contextual relationship in a video, handing you vector representations that power anything from analytics, recommendations, or even autonomous task execution.

**Natural Language Moment Search:** Pinpoint the exact second any event happened, even if you’re searching through a million hours of footage.

**Video-to-Text:** Convert video into text with dynamic summaries, descriptive captions, and Q\&A capabilities. Complete with automatic scene highlighting and characterization.

**Universal Metadata Tagging:** Detect and categorize objects, people, actions, sounds, and text. Customize tags to classify entire videos or drill down to individual scenes, all automatically out of the box.

**Fine-tuning:** For clients that need specialized domain understanding, our team will work with you to fine-tune a multi-modal pipeline that meets your requirements.

**Speed:** Receive your results within milliseconds, even if you’re querying a million hours of video

**Scalability:** Effortlessly scale with our production-grade cloud-native distributed infrastructure that can process thousands of concurrent requests.

# Use Cases

* Video-RAG Pipelines: TL;DW transforms video content into semantic embeddings that integrate with existing RAG architectures, enabling systems that reason across text and video simultaneously

* Media Production and Management: Production studios and broadcasters use TL;DW to quickly find specific scenes among decades of video archives, eliminating manual search time.

* Security: Teams can search across distributed camera networks using natural language queries like "person tailgating through the secure entrance," enabling proactive threat mitigation at scale.

* Online Education: Faculty members save time with preparation time and improve student outcomes through better content accessibility.
